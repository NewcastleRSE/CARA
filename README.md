**Note: this does not work on Google Chrome due to security restrictions, unless run on local host**

## Build & development

Install the latest long term support version of node. Using the NVM tool is probably the best way of doing this.

Run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`

Optional: run `npm install` to download and install all dependencies?

Run `bower install`

Install ruby and compass (http://compass-style.org/install/)

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
