    <p>This assessment is developed from a research project, examining reading comprehension with people with aphasia. The Stroke Association funded this initial research. Funding from Newcastle University's ESRC Impact Acceleration Account has supported production of the web based version of the assessment.</p>
    <p>Our heartfelt thanks go to people involved in the original research project. Thanks to the participants for their time and effort. Jenny Malone and Lois McCluskey, speech and language therapists and researchers, have been pivotal in the work, efficiently collecting data and contributing their insights from working with people on the project. The support and enthusiasm of people who helped identify participants is also appreciated, whether speech and language therapists, research nurses, Voice North or other contacts. We would also wish to thank the Aphasia Research User Group (ARUG) who patiently and constructively commented on earlier versions and helped us shape the research and improve the assessment. Our thanks to Jane Giles from Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Trust for all her support and input. Thanks too to Sophie Chalmers and Mark Chalmers-Williams for some very careful data crunching and to Sandra Lowing and Mathew Crowther for the artwork.</p>
    <p>The digital version of this assessment was created by Simon Woodman, Stephen Dowsland, Mark Turner and Mike Simpson from the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/digitalinstitute/" target="_blank">Digital Institute</a> at Newcastle university.</p>
