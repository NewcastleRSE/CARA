They began to put up the tent. They laughed as they tried to do it. They could only just remember how it all worked. Eventually it was up and they admired their hard work. It had become windy as they worked. They decided to put guy ropes on. Aisha searched for the ropes. Mary searched for the tent pegs. They emptied everything in the boot. The ropes and pegs were not there. The tent was blowing in the wind now. Aisha and Mary were not sure if it would stay up. They sat down disheartened. Just then, a man came across. He said he realised their problem. He asked them if they would like to borrow some ropes and pegs. They were grateful and relieved. They fixed their tent and had a well-earned rest.
